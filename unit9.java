Employee id
Employee Title
Employee salary
Create an application that uses the Employee class
Constructors â€“Getters and setters
A minimum of 3 constructors including default constructor
equals() method
Helper methods
toString() method
Create an array of 5 Employee objects
Use a Scanner to read in 5 employee information
Change 2 employees information (3-items each)
Create an Employee report at the end using appropriate class methods, to generate the report
_______________________________________________________________________________

This program gives a report on 5 different employees that the user enters.
The information is then taken, changed, and printed out back to the user as a report.
An employee class is created with 3 different constructor classes, and setter and getter methods
to meet the requirements of the assignment.
